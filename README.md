# Minesweeper with JavaFX

This is the classic Minesweeper implemented in Java using JavaFX.

It's currently still in construction so it's not fully working yet.

The goal is, that the user should be able to choose a grid size and the grid is going to adapt to that setting, so it's not just a static grid.
